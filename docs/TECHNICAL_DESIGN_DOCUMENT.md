# Mortgage Tycoon — Technical Design Document

**Version:** 1.0 · July 2026
**Companion to:** `GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md` (the "what"); this document is the "how."
**Audience:** AI coding agents (Claude Code) and human reviewers. Every implementation session must read this file and the GDD before writing code.

---

## 1. Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript (strict mode) | Type safety keeps AI-generated code consistent across sessions |
| UI | React 18 + Vite | All 10 designed screens are panel/card UI — React's home turf |
| State | Zustand | Simple store, no boilerplate, easy to serialize for saves |
| Styling | CSS Modules + CSS custom properties (design tokens) | Tokens map 1:1 to the Style Guide palette |
| Icons | lucide-react | Style Guide specifies Lucide outline icons |
| Fonts | Fraunces (headings) + Inter (body) via @fontsource | Per Style Guide |
| Animation | CSS transitions + Framer Motion for celebration moments | Confetti burst, reaction pops |
| Rendering (scenes) | **SVG/CSS components in v1 — no game engine yet** | See §1.1 |
| Testing | Vitest (engine unit tests only in v1) | Simulation must be testable headlessly |
| Persistence | localStorage + JSON export/import | No backend in v1 |
| Deploy | Static build → GitHub Pages | Free, zero-ops |

### 1.1 Decision: Phaser is deferred, not adopted

The original plan named Phaser. Reviewing the final mockups: 8 of 10 screens are pure UI (cards, Kanban, meters, trees). Only the **office scene** and **world map** are "game-looking," and both are static isometric compositions with gentle motion (idle bob, blink, ambient cars) — achievable with SVG + CSS keyframes at a fraction of the complexity. Adding a canvas engine now would double the architecture for two screens.

**Rule:** Build v1 engine-free. Revisit Phaser only if a post-v1 feature genuinely needs it (free-camera map, drag-to-place furniture, particles beyond confetti).

---

## 2. Architecture

**Prime directive: the simulation is a pure TypeScript engine with zero React imports.** The UI renders state and dispatches actions; it never computes game logic.

```
        ┌────────────────────────────┐
        │  /src/engine  (pure TS)    │
        │  tick(), reducers, RNG,    │
        │  balancing constants       │
        └────────────┬───────────────┘
                     │ GameState in / GameState out
        ┌────────────▼───────────────┐
        │  /src/store  (Zustand)     │
        │  holds GameState, exposes  │
        │  actions + selectors       │
        └────────────┬───────────────┘
                     │ hooks
        ┌────────────▼───────────────┐
        │  /src/ui  (React)          │
        │  screens, components,      │
        │  design tokens             │
        └────────────────────────────┘
```

Why this matters for AI-assisted development: the engine can be built and unit-tested without any UI existing, screens can be built against mock state without the engine existing, and a bug is always attributable to exactly one layer.

## 3. Data model (canonical interfaces)

These are the contract between engine, store, and UI. Extend them only by updating this document first.

```ts
// v2 (terminology pivot, GDD §3/§4): authentic stages, documents, roles, products.
type LoanStage = 'lead' | 'preQualification' | 'application'
               | 'documentCollection' | 'processing' | 'underwriting'

  badgesEarned: string[];            // achievement ids earned during the day (M7)
  highlights: { title: string; detail: string }[]; // up to 6 feed events (M7)
}
```

**Balancing rule:** every tunable number (fees, decay rates, event weights, costs) lives in `engine/constants.ts` with a comment referencing its GDD section. AI agents must never inline magic numbers into logic files.

---

## 4. Simulation model

- **Tick unit = 1 in-game hour**, 9 AM → 6 PM (10 ticks/day). `advanceHour()` progresses assigned loans, decays/boosts meters, and rolls the event table. `advanceDay()` runs 10 hours, computes the `DaySummary` (KPIs, star rating, badges), then pauses on the End-of-Day screen.
- **Player pacing:** the day advances on a real-time timer (10s per hour at 1× after playtest tuning — a full day ≈ 100s; pausable, 1×/2×/3× speed). All player actions (Request Documents, Contact, hiring, purchases) apply instantly between ticks.
- **Determinism:** all randomness flows through the seeded RNG so that `advanceDay(state, seed)` is reproducible — this is what makes the engine unit-testable and balancing tweaks comparable.
- **Stage advancement:** a loan advances when (a) its stage requirements are met (e.g. all required docs `collected` for documents→review), (b) an employee of the owning role has capacity, and (c) enough progress-hours have accumulated (skill and upgrades reduce hours needed).

---

## 5. Save system

- **Autosave** to `localStorage` key `mortgage-empire:save:v1` at end of each day and on tab hide.
- **Manual export/import** as a downloadable `.json` (the End-of-Day "Save" button) so progress survives cleared browser data.
- `meta.saveVersion` + a `migrations.ts` map keeps old saves loadable as the schema evolves. **Rule:** any change to `GameState` shape requires a migration entry in the same PR.
- **v1 → v2** (terminology pivot): renames document keys, maps old stages (`documents`→`documentCollection`, `review`→`processing`, `approval`→`underwriting`), splits `Loan.type` into `product`+`purpose` (`firstHome`→FHA·Purchase, `homePurchase`→Conventional·Purchase, `refinance`→Conventional·Refinance, `investment`→Conventional·Purchase), renames the `reviewer` role to `underwriter`, and adds the empty `glossary` map.
- **v2 → v3** (M5 Customer Profile): adds `Loan.delayed = false` and `Customer.happinessAtWeekStart = happiness`.
- **v3 → v4** (M6 Employees): adds `Employee.level = 1`.
- **v4 → v5** (M7 Economy): adds `todayRevenueByHour` (zeros), populates the `upgrades` map (tier 1 available, rest locked), and backfills the extended `DaySummary` fields on existing history.
- **v5 → v6** (M8 Map + Tutorial): adds `neighborhood.scouted` (true for non-locked so veterans keep their visible stats) and `meta.tutorialDone = true` for existing saves (only fresh games see the tutorial).
- **v6 → v7** (M8.1 fix): adds `xpAtDayStart` so the End-of-Day summary reports the whole day (revenue is recorded at the payout source; completions come from the day's events) instead of a rollover-instant diff that always read zero in live play.
- **v7 → v8** (art sprites): adds `Employee.spriteId` — gender-matched via the shared first-name table, assigned least-used-first so the cast stays distinct.
- **v9 → v10** (bigger office cast): character sprites 1, 2, and 8 retired; new sprites 9–16 joined the pool. Employees wearing a retired face are re-assigned a gender-matched, least-used one.
- **v10 → v11** (the Wall of Homes): adds `GameState.memoryWall: MemoryEntry[]` — a scrapbook page per funded loan (family portrait, house, product/purpose, closing date, persona-keyed thank-you note from `engine/content/memoryWall.ts`). The migration backfills pages for already-completed loans (their closing date is null — it was never stored). New `MemoryWall` screen, reachable from the dashboard sidebar.
- **Living team & customers (playtest 2026-07-06 #2, optional fields — no migration):** `effectiveness()` is never static: skill × workload strain (linear decline past `HIGH_WORKLOAD` 75% to the 0.5 floor at 100%) × morale (`HAPPY_SPEED_MIN..MAX` across happiness) × seniority (`LEVEL_SPEED_BONUS_PER_LEVEL` per level). `fireEmployee` (+`fireBlockedReason`): removes staff, reassigns their loans, costs every teammate `FIRE_TEAM_HAPPINESS_COST` happiness; the last owner of a stage can't be fired. Customers: trust shortens the document cadence (`TRUST_DOC_HOURS_OFF_PER_2_TRUST`); forgetful (new trait) or unhappy (<40) customers can botch a delivery (seeded, the wait restarts); repeat document requests escalate (`Customer.nagCount`, cost = base × count); Contact's trust gain grows with reputation (`REPUTATION_TRUST_FACTOR`) and famous offices (≥70 rep) spawn leads with +1 trust.
- **Knowledge, challenges & scaling (playtest 2026-07-06, all optional fields — no migration):** underwriting now requires 8 hours (a real waiting period). The career ladder extends to level 30 (`MAX_PLAYER_LEVEL`; thresholds grow +1,000 XP +200/step past level 6; titles clamp at Mortgage Mogul). Reading a glossary term pays `XP_PER_TERM_LEARNED`; every `QUIZ_EVERY_LEVELS` levels `checkLevelUp` sets `GameState.quiz` (term seeded per level) — the QuizModal pays `QUIZ_XP` for a correct pick and resolves either way. Challenges: from level 10 `maybeUnderwritingRedo` can bounce a loan back once (`Loan.underwritingRedo`, one document reverts, back through Document Collection); from level 20 customers at ≤`WALKAWAY_HAPPINESS` walk away overnight (loan + customer removed, reputation cost). Leads scale with level (`LEAD_CHANCE_PER_LEVEL`, cap +1 per 2 levels). Persona uniqueness: names and abouts never repeat within a save (hand-written pools → seeded generators, uniqueness-checked against existing customers); repeat portraits are paired with houses they haven't lived in (`Customer.houseId`, purchase dream-home flavor follows the house via `HOUSE_FLAVOR`; refinancers keep their own home's identity). Sarah Chen is the only fixed identity.
- **The office visibly grows** (GDD §7, UI-only — no save change): `officeStage(state)` in `engine/upgrades.ts` maps office-category tiers to Talia's staged art (0–1 tiers → `office-room-1.png`/`desk-1.png`, 2–3 → stage 2, 4–5 → stage 3; cap in `OFFICE_ART_STAGES`). `OfficeScene` swaps the backdrop and desk sprites per stage, each on its native canvas.
- **`GameState.disruption` needs no migration** (optional field, GDD §6 office mishaps): `{ kind, hoursLeft } | null`. Spawned mornings from day 6 (chance scales with player level, capped 25%), one at a time, in `engine/content/disruptions.ts`. Effects in `advanceHour`: wifiDown halts all loan work; printerJam stops document arrivals; systemUpdate halves work speed; coffeeOut hits team happiness once. Lead spawning also gained a "warm opening": a lead is guaranteed each morning until the office holds `WARM_OPENING_LOANS` total loans.
- **M9 Solo Founder (playtest 2026-07-06 #3, optional fields — no migration):** new games start with **no employees** — the founder does every job by hand until roles are hired (`starter.ts` ships `employees: {}`). In `workLoan`, unstaffed stages accrue hours at `PLAYER_SOLO_SPEED` (0.5×) and **never auto-advance**: `moveLoanForward` (gated by `moveBlockedReason`: requirements + `STAGE_HOURS_REQUIRED` waiting periods) is the founder's click. Per-role automation once hired (manual always stays available): the loan officer advances ready stages; the processor auto-requests documents (solo, the file sits until YOU request); the underwriter signs off one document per hour into `Loan.docApprovals` (solo, `approveDocument` per document — `requirementsMet('underwriting')` needs every sign-off); the closer closes. Support roles unlock by level (`ROLE_UNLOCK_LEVEL`: IT 5, Compliance 15 — UI-gated hire tabs): in-house IT halves disruption chance (`IT_DISRUPTION_CHANCE_FACTOR`), shortens fixes (`IT_DISRUPTION_HOURS_OFF`), and softens the coffee-morale hit; at level `AUDIT_LEVEL` (20) a one-time compliance audit (`GameState.auditDone`) passes (+`AUDIT_PASS_REPUTATION_BONUS`) with a Compliance Officer or docks `AUDIT_REPUTATION_PENALTY` reputation without. `fireBlockedReason` is now always null — the founder can cover any stage. Tutorial rewritten (14 steps) around the company-of-one arc.
- **Thank-you notes & referrals (playtest 2026-07-07, optional field — no migration):** `MemoryEntry.thanked` marks a Wall of Homes page whose family got a thank-you note back — once per borrower. `sendThankYouNote(state, loanId)` (playerActions) sets it and calls `spawnReferralLead` (leads.ts — the daily spawn body extracted into a shared `spawnLead`; referrals skip the daily luck AND the loan cap, seeded per day + customer count). New role `loanOfficerAssistant` (unlock level 8, `ROLE_UNLOCK_LEVEL`): each morning in `advanceDay` it mails `ASSISTANT_THANK_YOUS_PER_MORNING` (1) note(s) automatically. Wall cards grow a "Send a thank-you note" button / "sent" chip.
- **Manual flow polish (playtest 2026-07-07, no save change):** `MANUAL_MOVE_INSTANT_STAGES` (lead, preQualification, application, documentCollection) — a manual Continue click moves these instantly (no waiting period; requirements like "all documents in" still gate documentCollection). Waiting periods bind manual moves from processing onward; automation always works by the hour. `requestDocument`/`requestAllDocuments` now refuse before the loan reaches documentCollection (UI hides/disables the buttons too). Tutorial: spotlight targets scroll into view (`block: 'start'`, `scroll-margin-top`) and track page scroll — fixes phones, where the dashboard scrolls; the card caps at 58vh in spotlight mode, nav dots hide, and Previous/Next share the row.
- **v8 → v9** (borrower art): backfills Sarah Chen's `portraitId`/`about`. The customer portrait fields are otherwise optional — new leads get them from their archetype (one persona per borrower portrait, `borrower-2..14.png`); other pre-v9 customers keep the procedural drawn portrait. Lead spawning cycles the whole cast before any portrait repeats (least-used-first); a repeat arrives under its next alternate name with the art untouched (no tinting — art variety comes from adding more images).

## 6.1 MortgageGlossary service (v2, GDD §4.1)

- `src/engine/content/glossary.ts` is the **single source of truth** for every term: key, display term, category, definition, whyItMatters, whereInProcess (a `LoanStage`), optional funFact, related keys. No definition text may live anywhere else — components render from this module. Centralized strings keep the app localization-ready.
- UI: `src/ui/glossary/GlossaryTerm.tsx` renders a bold term + ⓘ button and the tooltip (definition / why it matters / journey tracker with highlighted stage / fun fact; pinnable; Escape + outside-click close; adjustable text size persisted in `localStorage` under `mortgage-empire:ui:glossary-size`).
- Progressive state lives in `GameState.glossary` (per save): `unlocked` = term appeared in gameplay UI; `learned` = player opened it. Learning Center completion % = learned / total.

## 6. Design tokens

`src/ui/tokens.css` transcribes GDD §12 exactly: the 16 palette colors, radius scale (10/14/20/999px), shadow `0 6px 20px #2E241714`, focus ring, and font stacks. Components consume only `var(--…)` tokens — no hex codes in component files. This is the single place a future re-theme happens.

---

## 7. AI development workflow

Create `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root containing, at minimum:

```md
# Mortgage Tycoon — agent instructions
1. Read docs/GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md and docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md before coding.
2. The GDD defines behavior; the TDD defines structure. Do not invent mechanics or rename concepts.
3. Engine code (src/engine) must have zero React imports and no magic numbers (use constants.ts).
4. UI uses design tokens only — no raw hex colors in components.
5. Voice rule for all player-facing strings: friendly coworker, no jargon
   ("papers" not "documents", "yes/no" not "approval").
6. Work on exactly one milestone per session. Run `npm run typecheck && npm test` before finishing.
7. Update docs first if the implementation requires a design change; flag it in the commit message.
```

**Session pattern (one milestone per session):**
> "Read CLAUDE.md and both docs. Implement Milestone N from TDD §8. Acceptance criteria are listed there. Do not start Milestone N+1."

Small, verifiable sessions prevent the classic failure mode: the agent inventing mechanics mid-build and drifting from the design.

---

## 8. Milestones

Each milestone ends in a working, committed build. Acceptance criteria are testable by playing for 2 minutes.

**M0 — Scaffold** · Vite + React + TS strict + Zustand + Vitest + tokens.css + CLAUDE.md; empty screen router; deploys to GitHub Pages. ✅ *Blank themed app loads in browser; CI green.*

**M1 — Engine core (no UI)** · types, constants, RNG, clock, one hardcoded customer+loan advancing through all 7 stages via `advanceHour()`; unit tests for stage transitions. ✅ *`npm test` proves a loan goes lead→completed deterministically.*

**M2 — Main Menu + save system** · Main Menu screen per mockup; New Game (name + office name), Continue, autosave/load, export/import. ✅ *Start a game, refresh browser, Continue restores it.*

**M3 — Dashboard shell** · Top KPI bar, sidebar nav, notification panel wired to eventLog; static office scene (SVG, idle bob). ✅ *KPIs tick as hours pass; notifications appear.*

**M4 — Pipeline + loan detail** · 7-column Kanban bound to real loans, summary metrics, detail popover with Move/Contact/Request actions. ✅ *Advance a real loan to Completed from the board; confetti fires.*

**M5 — Customer Profile** · Full 3-column screen: traits, happiness, trust, dream home, journey tracker, checklist, 4 action buttons; prev/next paging. ✅ *Requesting docs changes checklist state and happiness.*

**M6 — Employees** · Hire pool, role tabs, cards with meters/tags, Train/Promote/Assign; workload actually gates loan progress. ✅ *An overworked employee slows loans; hiring fixes it.*

**M7 — Economy + Upgrades + End of Day** · Payroll, closing fees, three currencies; 25-node upgrade tree with effects; End-of-Day screen (KPIs, hourly chart, events, badges, star rating); XP/levels/titles gate features per GDD §10. ✅ *A full day loop plays start to finish with meaningful money pressure.*

**M8 — World Map + Tutorial + polish** · Meadowbrook map, scouting, branch purchase, per-neighborhood leads; 7-step tutorial overlay; sound pass; balancing pass on constants.ts. ✅ *New player can go from New Game through the tutorial to opening the Riverside Village branch.*

**Post-v1 backlog:** Reports screen, per-branch staffing, Share card export, seasonal events, Phaser evaluation, more archetypes.

---

## 9. Coding standards (summary)

TypeScript strict, no `any`. Functional React components + hooks only. Engine functions are pure: `(state, action|rng) → state`. Named exports. Prettier defaults. Conventional commits (`feat(engine): …`, `feat(ui): …`). One PR/commit per milestone step; never mix engine and UI refactors in one commit.
